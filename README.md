Abstract:


The study investigated the viability of Google Graphcast, an AI-powered weather prediction model, as an alternative to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, with comparisons to Open-Meteo and ERA5. The research was motivated by the need for more efficient and accurate weather predictions, particularly in light of global warming. Graphcast's benefits include its speed, accuracy, and open-source nature. The study focused on evaluating Graphcast's potential viability as a replacement for NWP models, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize weather forecasting and improve responses to extreme weather events.

The investigation approach consisted of three primary stages: data collection, data modeling, and data analysis. During data collection, Google Graphcast was used to forecast weather predictions over a 10-day timeframe. This data was processed and displayed in graphs during the modeling stage, before being analyzed during the final stage. Graphcast’s forecasts were compared to Open-Meteo’s NWP forecasts and ERA5 data (observed weather) for accuracy. Melbourne, Australia, was chosen as the location for comparison due to its complex weather patterns and high-quality weather data.

The accuracy and potential of Graphcast as a substitute for conventional NWP models were evaluated using statistical metrics and visualizations. The findings indicated that although Graphcast initially demonstrated high precision, its predictions became more inconsistent when temperatures varied quickly. While Graphcast performed approximately 0.5°C worse than Open-Meteo in terms of overall accuracy (though results varied at specific points), its minimal computational resource consumption highlighted its potential.

The study concludes that while Graphcast is not yet able to consistently outperform NWP models in all aspects, its effectiveness and potential for development suggest it could become a viable tool for weather forecasting in the future, particularly for consumer applications.
